        # ⚠️ IMPORTANT: SECURITY VULNERABILITIES SHOULD NOT BE REPORTED PUBLICLY ⚠️
        
        This template will create a public issue, but for security vulnerabilities, please use one of these private reporting methods:
        
        1. **Preferred**: Use GitHub's [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
        2. **Alternative**: Email the maintainer privately
        
        If you accidentally created a public issue, please close it and report privately instead.
