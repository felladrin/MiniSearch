<details>
  <summary>Why is MiniSearch built upon SearXNG's Docker Image and using a single image instead of composing it from multiple services?</summary>
  <p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>MiniSearch utilizes SearXNG as its meta-search engine.</li>
    <li>Manual installation of SearXNG is not trivial, so we use the docker image they provide, which has everything set up.</li>
    <li>SearXNG only provides a Docker Image based on Alpine Linux.</li>
    <li>The user of the image needs to be customized in a specific way to run on HuggingFace Spaces, where MiniSearch's demo runs.</li>
    <li>HuggingFace only accepts a single docker image. It doesn't run docker compose or multiple images, unfortunately.</li>
  </ul>

  <summary>What is the Internal OpenAI-compatible API option, and how do I use it?</summary>
  <p>MiniSearch supports an Internal OpenAI-compatible API option for text generation. This feature allows you to leverage the API while maintaining the privacy and control benefits when serving MiniSearch for others. To use this feature:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Set up your OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.</li>
    <li>Configure the following environment variables in your <code>.env</code> file:
      <ul>
        <li><code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_BASE_URL</code>: The base URL for your API</li>
        <li><code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY</code>: Your API access key</li>
        <li><code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_MODEL</code>: The model to use</li>
        <li><code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_NAME</code>: The name to display in the UI</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Restart MiniSearch.</li>
    <li>In the MiniSearch menu, select the new option (named as per your <code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_NAME</code> setting) from the inference type dropdown.</li>
  </ol>
